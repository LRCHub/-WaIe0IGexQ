[00:14.74] Tip toe on to the dusty deck
[00:18.15] The squeaking of the rusty plank
[00:21.31] Can you see anything in your sight?
[00:24.55] This is gonna be a spooky night
[00:40.05] 
[00:27.88] A shadow slips behind that door
[00:30.93] Someone giggling, can you hear it?
[00:34.16] Something's moving down below, I know
[00:37.46] Set the trap, we'll find out for sure
[00:55.96] 
[00:40.39] This is gonna be a fantastic time tonight
[00:43.42] We're not scared to see what hides from the light
[00:46.66] Zappers, snacks and candy bars ready for this night
[00:49.87] Grab your gear, pack up, it's time to boom the ghost, alright!
[01:20.87] 
[00:53.25] Boom the ghost, boom it all the way
[00:56.16] Nothing can stop us on this uncanny day (today)
[00:59.80] Boom the ghost, boom it all the way
[01:02.47] We gonna sweep out everything, clear the way
[01:06.03] Stick together, magical ride
[01:09.30] We'll see the end to this mystery night
[01:12.47] Just remember, have some fun tonight (oh, yeah!)
[01:36.47] 
[01:28.55] Who's got the grit to probe in the nighttime?
[01:31.52] I'm about to hunt a ghost now, watch my showtime
[01:34.70] I'll show them all, I'm not just a pretty face
[01:37.95] Nesting inside, I got swagger in a higher place
[02:01.45] 
[01:41.41] Tip toe turns to a speedy dash
[01:44.67] Thrill kicks in like a thunder crash
[01:47.91] Feel the chill and the upcoming heat
[01:51.36] Heart is pounding to a ghostly beat
[02:08.86] 
[01:54.68] Jump that stair then slide down the rail
[01:57.79] Ghost in sight and we will not fail
[02:01.07] Laugh it off when traps go pop, pop, pop
[02:04.20] One more down, we won't stop, stop, stop
[02:24.20] 
[02:07.13] This is gonna be a fantastic time tonight
[02:10.32] We're not scared to see what hides from the light
[02:13.61] Zappers, snacks and candy bars ready for this night
[02:16.78] Grab your gear, pack up, it's time to boom the ghost, alright!
[02:47.78] 
[02:20.50] Throw away all your predictions
[02:25.85] Come and just enjoy the superstitions
[02:32.46] Tonight, we are the crew with nothing to fear
[02:36.25] Dancing along, the ghosts are near
[02:39.16] No haunted boat can handle this cheer
[02:42.68] Let's end it loud, and boom ghosts tonight
[03:03.68] 
[02:48.02] Boom the ghost, boom it all the way
[02:50.22] Nothing can stop us on this uncanny day (today)
[02:54.33] Boom the ghost, boom it all the way
[02:56.88] We gonna sweep out everything, clear the way
[03:00.33] Stick together, magical ride
[03:03.70] We'll see the end to this mystery night
[03:06.82] Just remember, have some fun tonight (oh, yeah!)
